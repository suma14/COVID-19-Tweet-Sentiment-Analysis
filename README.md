### 🦠 COVID-19 Tweet Sentiment Analysis using LSTM
### 📌 Project Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on COVID-19–related tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Deep Learning LSTM model.
The goal is to analyze public sentiment during the COVID-19 pandemic by classifying tweets into sentiment categories.

## The project includes:

Text preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction using one-hot encoding and padding

Sentiment classification using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks

### 🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess unstructured tweet data

Convert text into numerical representations

Build and train an LSTM-based deep learning model

Evaluate sentiment classification performance

### 📂 Dataset
